# Global Project Rules

## Languages & Stack
- Prefer **TypeScript** for all new code (`.ts`, `.tsx`).
- Next.js (App Router) + React functional components only.
- Follow existing project setup for tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind, CVA, Radix UI, TanStack Query, GraphQL, sonner).

## Code Style & Structure
- Match existing **imports, naming, and folder structure** when adding new files.
- Keep components and modules **small and focused**. Extract shared logic into `@/lib` (for domain logic) or `@/types` (for shared types).
- Avoid large, multi-purpose files. Prefer splitting into separate modules when responsibility diverges.

## Type Safety
- Prefer explicit types and interfaces over `any`.
- Reuse shared types from `@/types/index.ts` when possible.
- When adding new public APIs or modules, export well-named types/interfaces alongside the implementation.

## Comments & Documentation
- Do **not** remove existing comments or documentation unless they are clearly obsolete.
- When changing important behavior, update relevant comments or add short notes where it helps future readers.

## AI Assistant Usage
- Treat AI-generated code as a **starting point**, not final truth.
- Always verify:
  - TypeScript compilation (no type errors).
  - Runtime behavior (e.g. via local testing).
- Prefer smaller, incremental changes that are easy to review and reason about.
